Following this challenge statement to create an enviornemnt for people who are nuero-divergent to be able to participate in the activity of DJing while
being able to concurrently track their current state of mind, adjust to when there is a stimulant causing them to become censorly overloaded, and be able to keep data
on students to use to further improve their education

We began with creating a system that allows for the instructor to be able to monitor multiple students as shown below

Using technology such as an apple watch and using the data collection to monitor health data on each student the instructor can monitor multiple students through the application
aswell as notice points where they need to step in when seeing a color change on their graph from white, to yellow, and finally red. When this occurs the student will be prompted with an interface that will allow for them to
tap on a screen for what is the reason they are being caused discomfort if it ranges from somewhere on their body, or an external source such as temperature, sound, or light.

Each student that participates inside of Spin the Spectrum will be given account as shown below

Inside this profile there will be key data held such as triggers, their progress on their program, and numerous other items that allow for an instructor to tailor the care that they give to each individual student

Next there is a page that allows for an instuctor to review past sessions

By using this process of having film to review instructors can identify key moments or events that were shown to be the point that impacted the student the most before they became overwhelmed
